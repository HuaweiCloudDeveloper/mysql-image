## Repository Introduction
[Mysql](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) is one of the world's most widely used open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS). With its high performance, high availability, flexibility, and strong community support, it has become an indispensable core component in web application development.

### **Core Features:**

- **High Performance:**
  - Supports a multi-threaded architecture, capable of handling thousands of connection requests simultaneously.
  - Provides mechanisms such as index optimization and query caching to significantly improve query efficiency.
  - Highly scalable, suitable for TB-level data storage and read/write operations, widely used in scenarios with high performance requirements such as e-commerce and social platforms.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:**
  - Supports mainstream operating systems including Windows, Linux, macOS, etc., and can be deployed and run in almost all server environments, with good portability and adaptability.
- **Rich Data Type Support:**
  - Basic types: integers (INT), floating-point numbers (FLOAT/DOUBLE), strings (CHAR/VARCHAR).
  - Date and time types: DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP.
  - Special types: TEXT, BLOB, JSON, etc., supporting mixed storage of structured and unstructured data.
- **Security and Reliability:**
  - User permission management: Supports user-based accounts, passwords, and access control.
  - Data backup and recovery: Full or incremental backups can be performed using the mysqldump tool.
  - Supports transaction processing (ACID properties) to ensure data consistency and integrity.
- **Flexible Scalability:**
  - Master-Slave Replication: Implements read-write separation to improve concurrent processing capabilities.
  - Cluster deployment (such as MySQL Cluster): Provides high availability and load balancing.
  - Plug-in storage engines: Such as InnoDB (supports transactions), MyISAM (fast reading speed), etc., which can be flexibly selected according to business needs.
